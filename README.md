## About

Full Stack Engineer at Talent Path in the DMV area living in Washington, DC. My initial interest in code began through building music applications in my bachelors of Music Theory at the University of Georgia and wanted to bring my analytical and pattern-based approach to other kinds of applications. I completed the Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech with skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ReactJS, Express, and Sequelize with MySQL and Postgres, and mongoose with MongoDB. My training at Talent Path has exposed me to Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and Vue. I also have experience with audio DSP frameworks like MaxMSP, SuperCollider, and PureData and with graphics libraries like p5.js, Three.js, and glslify. I believe that there is a wealth of creative solutions to every problem and collaboration through code is the most exciting way to find those solutions.
